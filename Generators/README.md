# Generating datasets for analysis and graphing
You might have noticed that there isn't a 'Datasets' folder in this repository. I can furnish them for you, but they're too large for Github. You can email me at jesse dot gilmer at cuanschutz if you want them. Alternately, you can use the included generators to create datasets from scratch.
